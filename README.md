# puffpastry

```puffpastry``` is a very basic feedforward neuron network library with a focus on parity with mathematical represenations. It can be used to create and train very basic models without much overhead. 
## Usage
```puffpastry``` is used very similarly to keras - stack layers and fit to training data.  
## Features
Activation functions: ```[softmax, relu, sigmoid, linear]``` <br />
Loss functions: ```[categorical cross entropy, mean squared error]``` <br />
Layers: ```[dense]``` <br />
## Roadmap
1. Convulational Layers (Layer rework in general)
2. Documentation
3. Tools to build GANs
